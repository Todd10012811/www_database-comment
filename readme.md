Hi jeff
I have modifyed my .env file so I have included it, please use it or else my pages migh not work properly. Also my database sql commands need to be run seperatly one at a time, im not sure why this is but if you load each one seperatly it works so please ensure the following tables load and insert the given data into them: 

TABLE AppointmentRequest
TABLE ContactForm
TABLE Content
TABLE Images
TABLE Comments
TABLE Products

Also remember to take into account that I could not get any new CSS to work in the later stages of this assignment and therefore could have looked better and been more responcive. Also the same with the JavaScript. PS. Thanks for all your help jeff!
